# Firebase Security Rules Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a common, yet elusive, bug related to Firebase Realtime Database security rules.  Despite having what appear to be correctly configured rules, unexpected behavior occurs due to discrepancies between the client-side code and the server-side rules evaluation.

The problem arises in two primary ways:

1. **Client-side code errors:** Incorrectly fetching or using user authentication data (like UIDs) leads to authorization failures, even with correctly written rules.
2. **Data structure inconsistencies:** Data structured differently than anticipated by the rules causes unexpected rule evaluations and denies access.

The solution involves carefully reviewing both the security rules and the client-side code for these potential problems.  Thorough testing and debugging are key to identifying the specific cause.
